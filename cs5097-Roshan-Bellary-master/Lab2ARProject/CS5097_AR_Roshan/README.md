Lab 2 - First AR Project.

Detect plane surfaces and tap to place snowman at tapped place. We can also move the placed snowman.

The Script added to do that was AR Tap to Place.cs in the scripts folder. All other scripts came with the AR unity template. There is a particle system 
for showing the snow as well.

There are 2 screenshots in the root directory of CS5097_AR_Roshan/ which show the snowman and the snow (and my horrible photography).
